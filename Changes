Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Rot13.

v0.6  Thu Apr 20 23:25:17 2000
        - worked over the documentation again.  It's very good now.
        - made some minor changes to code appearance.
        - made test.pl more sophisticated.
        - changed the version numbering scheme.

0.05  Wed Apr 19 15:48:03 2000
        - made the documentation a little more sophisticated.
        - ditto w.r.t. the rot13 () method.  It's using an algorithm
          I discovered while implementing rot13 in scheme a while
          back, which is probably why it looks so strange.
        - made test.pl a little more comprehensive, something not done
          in the 0.04 version.
        - added 'rot13.perl', a program which demonstrates
          pretty much the entire use of Crypt::Rot13.
        - optimized rot13 () on rotations equal or effectively equal
          to '13'.
